<span class = "initial">"R</span>eader, this is a blog. My name is **Laura-Ana-Maria Bostan** and I'm a still a student, self taught mathematician and writer; and I don't just write fiction. Welcome to my **pityasambÃ«** - mychamber of paradise. You can find me on facebook, twitter or on github by searching **sarnthil**. Do you think my writing is unclear, inconsistent and the work of a madman? Shoot me an email at `sarnthil@gmail.com` and make me happy.

##Gist of the Matter
It is my firm hope that someday somewhere on terra firma some poor soul will find my writing helpful. I mainly write -- regretfully -- about mathematics. But I also write about ancient history, the sciences and philosophy. I also love to make things with my hand. I love anything mechanical, especially if it's old and battered. I believe only in the empirical. The unknown is merely a conjecture I have yet to prove.
