<span class = "initial">"R</span>eader, this is a blog. My name is **Laura-Ana-Maria Bostan** and I'm a still a student, self taught writer; and I don't just write fiction. Welcome to my **pityasambÃ«**. You can find me on facebook, twitter, last.fm  or on github by searching **sarnthil**. Do you think my writing is a scrawly, schlocky or somewhat interesting?  Shoot me an email at `sarnthil@gmail.com` and make me happy.

I still hope that someday somewhere on internet will find this helpful. I mainly write -- regretfully -- about my life as a student. But I also write about mathematics, informatics, history, the sciences and philosophy. I believe in the empirical.
